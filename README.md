# *Don't* Stand Me Up... For Jetstackers
Anyone who knows me, knows that I am terrible at doing my standup. Well, no longer! This script generates my standup after I have used the app `Daily` for Mac, to log my time.

**Top Tip ⏰: Still set an alarm for the end of the day, to make sure you actually carry out these steps 😂**

**Extra Tip: I just have this set as a bash alias `alias standmeup="python3 /Users/thomas.meadows/Documents/standup-gen/standmeup.py"`**

1. run `python3 standup_gen.py`
2. Paste into Slack
3. Stop worrying, you're now a standup ninja 🥷
